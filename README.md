# Recipes

This is a personal recipe collection and gallery.
Recipes are ``.yml`` files that are parsed by [serztle/nom](https://github.com/serztle/nom).
You can view the website locally by installing ``nom`` and executing the server in this repo:

```bash
$ go get github.com/serztle/nom
$ git clone https://github.com/studentkittens/recipes
$ cd recipes
$ nom serve
Visit localhost:8080
```

[The final gallery is also visible online!](https://studentkittens.github.io/recipes)

Have fun cooking!
